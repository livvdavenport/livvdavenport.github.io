    "section": "",
    "text": "The Kansas City Royals have won two World Series Championships. One in 1985, the other in 2015. 10 years later, the Royals are working toward a third championship with the help of young star Bobby Witt Jr. \nThe Royals drafted Witt second overall in the 2019 MLB draft. Witt made his MLB debut in 2022 and has made an almost instant impact in Kansas City. He is the only shortstop to reach 30-30 seasons (30 Homeruns and 30 Stolen Bases), and he didn’t only do it once, he did it twice. And he’s only played two seasons in the league.\nWitt has made the largest impact offensively. Offensive WAR (oWAR) stands for offensive wins above replacement. Simply put, oWAR measures how many wins a player adds to their team based on their offensive stats compared to an average player. The larger the number, the better they are, the more wins they have added for their team.\nDefensively, Witt is still making a positive impact, but it is not as notable as his offensive performance. Rey Sánchez tops the chart defensively.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\n\nbballhits &lt;- read_csv(\"mlb_hitter_stats_1914_2024.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Player=gsub(\"#\",\"\",Player, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt; \n  mutate(Player=gsub(\"*\",\"\",Player, fixed=TRUE))\n\nbballvalue &lt;- read_csv(\"mlb_hitter_value_1914_2024.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Player=gsub(\"#\",\"\",Player, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt; \n  mutate(Player=gsub(\"*\",\"\",Player, fixed=TRUE))\n\nroyalshits &lt;- bballhits |&gt; \n  filter(Team == \"KCR\") |&gt; \n  filter(Season &gt; 1984) |&gt; \n  filter(grepl(\"\\\\*6\", Pos) == TRUE)\n\nroyalsvalue &lt;- bballvalue |&gt; \n  filter(Team == \"KCR\") |&gt; \n  filter(season &gt; 1984) |&gt; \n  filter(grepl(\"\\\\*6\", Pos) == TRUE) |&gt; \n  mutate(PlayerSeason = paste(Player, season)) \n\n\nbobby2023 &lt;- royalshits |&gt; \n  filter(Player == \"Bobby Witt Jr.\") |&gt; \n  filter(Season == \"2023\")\n\nbobby2024 &lt;- royalshits |&gt; \n  filter(Player == \"Bobby Witt Jr.\") |&gt; \n  filter(Season == \"2024\")\n\nbobbyvalue2023 &lt;- royalsvalue |&gt; \n  filter(Player == \"Bobby Witt Jr.\") |&gt; \n  filter(season == \"2023\")\n\nbobbyvalue2024 &lt;- royalsvalue |&gt; \n  filter(Player == \"Bobby Witt Jr.\") |&gt; \n  filter(season == \"2024\")\n\nbar1 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = royalsvalue, aes(x=reorder(PlayerSeason, oWAR), weight=oWAR), fill = \"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_bar(data = bobbyvalue2023, aes(x=reorder(PlayerSeason, oWAR), weight=oWAR), fill = \"#004687\") +\n  geom_bar(data = bobbyvalue2024, aes(x=reorder(PlayerSeason, oWAR), weight=oWAR), fill = \"#004687\") +coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Offensive Wins Above Replacement\" \n    )\n\nbar2 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = royalsvalue, aes(x=reorder(PlayerSeason, dWAR), weight=dWAR), fill=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_bar(data = bobbyvalue2023, aes(x=reorder(PlayerSeason, dWAR), weight=dWAR), fill = \"#004687\") +\n  geom_bar(data = bobbyvalue2024, aes(x=reorder(PlayerSeason, dWAR), weight=dWAR), fill = \"#004687\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Defensive Wins Above Replacement\"\n    )\n\nbar1 + bar2 + \n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"Offensively, Bobby Witt Jr. is flourishing\",\n    subtitle = \"In his second year in the league, Witt no only beat himself, but topped every \\nother shortstop in the offensive category.

Rbat shows how many runs a player generates with their bat.\nFor both of these statistics, zero is the baseline and positive numbers equal a positive correlation.\nWhen it comes to the Rfield value, +15 is Golden Glove territory, and +5 to +15 is above average. -5 to –15 is not abysmal, but they are hurting their team significantly.\nRbat is similar in the fact that positive numbers are a good thing. In two seasons Bobby Witt Jr. has created more runs with his bat than any other short stop that has played for the Royals.\nDefensively, he is slightly below average and still Rey Sánchez’s impact shows up in the field.\n\n\nCode\ncareerRvalues &lt;- royalsvalue |&gt; \n  group_by(Player) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    CareerRfield = sum(Rfield),\n    CareerRbat =sum(Rbat)\n    )\nggplot() +\n  geom_dumbbell(data=careerRvalues, aes(y=Player, x=CareerRfield, xend=CareerRbat),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"lightgrey\",\n    colour_x = \"#BD9B60\",\n    colour_xend = \"#004687\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept=0, color=\"red\", size = .5) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n    labs(title = \"Offense is his forte, but he holds his ground defensively\", \n         subtitle = \"Witt is scoring significantly more runs than a replacement player would and defensively,\\nhe is just below average.\",\n         y=\"\",\n         x=\"Runs Contributed vs Runs Stopped\",\ncaption = \"Source: Sports Reference | By Olivia Davenport\") +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) \n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\nWarning: Using the `size` aesthetic with geom_segment was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use the `linewidth` aesthetic instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaking a closer look at offense, Witt makes the top three in offensive production. Playing in 319 games in his first two seasons, he made an instant impact. He is third to Alcides Escobar, who played more than 1,000 games for Kansas City, and Ángel Berroa who played 583 games. With much fewer chances, Witt has done nearly as much as Berroa. Witt’s success has been noticed as he was selected for the 2024 All-Star game.\n\n\nCode\ncareer &lt;- royalshits |&gt; \n  group_by(Player) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    CareerHR = sum(HR),\n    CareerRBI = sum(RBI),\n    CareerDoubles = sum(`2B`),\n    CareerTriples = sum(`3B`),\n    Offense = CareerHR + CareerRBI\n  )\nScoring &lt;- career |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols=starts_with(\"C\"),\n    names_to=\"Type\"\n  )\n\n ggplot() +\n   geom_bar(data=Scoring, aes(x=reorder(Player,Offense), weight=Offense, fill = Type)) +\n   scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"#004687\",\"#BD9B60\",\"#7AB2DD\",\"lightgrey\"), name=\"\") +\n   coord_flip() +\n   theme_minimal() +\n   labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Offensive Production\",\n    title=\"At the plate, Witt is a problem for pitchers\", \n    subtitle=\"With over 200 fewer games under his belt, Bobby Witt Jr. is comparable to \\nÁngel Berroa when it comes to offensive appearances.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Olivia Davenport\"\n    ) +\n     theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBobby Witt Jr. Is certainly a key piece to the Royals success and the Royals front office knows that. Witt recently signed an 11-year deal worth more than $288 million.\nLast year, the Royals made it back to the postseason for the first time since their last World Series win in 2015 and there is no doubt, Witt had something to do with that. The Royals finished 86-76 last year after 109 losses the season before. Baseball is a team sport, but Bobby Witt Jr. Single-handedly makes the Royals better."

    "text": "In college volleyball, there are usually a few stand out athletes. Most of the time these players are hitters that seem like a setter’s go-to option. In 2020, 2022 and 2023, one of these stand out athletes was Madi Skinner. Skinner, who is now a three-time National Champion and a recent LOVB champion made herself known in the college volleyball world.\nSkinner reached champion status three times at two different universities. The first, Kentucky, where she was a freshman. Skinner played alongside her sister Avery Skinner when Kentucky won their first National Championship. There, she lurked in the shadows behind star outside Alli Stumler and her Sister Avery, but she was still utilized and as a freshman in the SEC, that’s impressive.\nIn 2022, Skinner transferred to the University of Texas. There she was able to relish in the spotlight. Skinner was a go to hitter for the Longhorns in their back-to-back National Championship wins. She helped lead the team to the title in 2022 and 2023. Is it a coincidence that three of the four teams Skinner was on won it all? And remember, this was at two different universities.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nseason1 &lt;- read_csv(\"ncaa_womens_volleyball_playerstats_2020.csv\")\nseason2 &lt;- read_csv(\"ncaa_womens_volleyball_playerstats_2022.csv\")\nseason3 &lt;- read_csv(\"ncaa_womens_volleyball_playerstats_2023.csv\")\n\nkentucky &lt;- season1 |&gt; \n  filter(team == \"Kentucky Wildcats\")\nskinnerkentucky &lt;- kentucky |&gt; \n  filter(full_name == \"Madi Skinner\")\n\ntexas &lt;- season2 |&gt; \n  filter(team == \"Texas Longhorns\")\nskinnertexas1 &lt;- season2 |&gt; \n  filter(full_name == \"Madisen Skinner\")\n\nskinnertexas2 &lt;- season3 |&gt; \n  filter(team == \"Texas Longhorns\") |&gt; \n  filter(full_name == \"Madisen Skinner\")\n\ntexas2 &lt;- season3 |&gt; \n  filter(team == \"Texas Longhorns\")\n\n\nchart1 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=kentucky, aes(x=reorder(full_name, pts), weight=pts)) +\n  geom_bar(data=skinnerkentucky, aes(x=reorder(full_name, pts), weight=pts), fill = \"#0033A0\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\",\n    y=\"Points\"\n  )\n\nchart2 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=texas, aes(x=reorder(full_name, pts), weight=pts)) +\n  geom_bar(data=skinnertexas1, aes(x=reorder(full_name, pts), weight=pts), fill = \"#bf5700\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\",\n    y=\"Points\"\n  )\n\nchart3 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=texas2, aes(x=reorder(full_name, pts), weight=pts)) +\n  geom_bar(data=skinnertexas2, aes(x=reorder(full_name, pts), weight=pts), fill = \"#bf5700\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\",\n    y=\"Points\"\n  )\n\nchart1 + chart2 + chart3 +\n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"Madi Skinner became much more impactful as her career continued\",\n    subtitle = \"Among the three different teams she won National Championships with, Skinner was one of the top point scorers.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Sports Reference | By Olivia Davenport\"\n  )  & \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkinner was scoring points for all three of these teams and she was doing it efficiently. Defensively, Skinner can hold her own, but she truly shines on offense, which is to be expected of an outside hitter. But, there is something special about Skinner’s offense and her ability to mix up shots.\nAt Kentucky, Skinner’s usage was lower. Again, she was a freshman playing in the SEC, the second hardest conference in collegiate volleyball. The first: The Big Ten.\nTexas is really when things started to amp up for Skinner. Both National Championship teams at Texas were very reliant on the right arm of Madi Skinner. In 2022, the only athlete to take more swings than her was Logan Eggleston. She was named the tournament’s most outstanding player. She was also the Big 12 player of the year three years in a row.\nIn Skinner’s second season at Texas, she was the star. Her total usage towered above the rest of her teammates and so did her kills. This was the year of Madi Skinner and she ended on top.\n\n\nCode\nbar1 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=kentucky, aes(x=total_attacks, y=kills)) +\n  geom_point(data=skinnerkentucky, aes(x=total_attacks, y=kills), color =\"#0033A0\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=skinnerkentucky, aes(x=total_attacks, y=kills, label = \"Madi Skinner\")\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Total Attacks\", \n    y=\"Kills\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nbar2 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=texas, aes(x=total_attacks, y=kills)) +\n  geom_point(data=skinnertexas1, aes(x=total_attacks, y=kills), color =\"#bf5700\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=skinnertexas1, aes(x=total_attacks, y=kills, label = \"Madi Skinner\")\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Total Attacks\", \n    y=\"Kills\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nbar3 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=texas2, aes(x=total_attacks, y=kills)) +\n  geom_point(data=skinnertexas2, aes(x=total_attacks, y=kills), color =\"#bf5700\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=skinnertexas2, aes(x=total_attacks, y=kills, label = \"Madi Skinner\")\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Total Attacks\", \n    y=\"Kills\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nbar1 + bar2 + bar3 +\n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"Skinner demanded more attention each year\",\n    subtitle = \"Each year, Skinner grew into a much larger role, until she was the top dog.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Sports Reference | By Olivia Davenport\"\n  )  & \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlright, we get it. Skinner was a large part of the success of all three National Championship teams, but how good is she really compared to the rest of the outsides?\nShe’s still pretty damn good. Her freshman year, she was right in the middle of the road. She didn’t do anything extraordinary, but she was starting to carve a place for her name in NCAA volleyball.\nIn her first year at Texas, things started to pick up. She was being set and she was getting kills.\nIn her second year at Texas, when they won their second title in a row, Skinner was at the top of the food chain. Very few outsides were outsides were competing at the level she was. Unfortunately for Lexi Rodriguez and the Nebraska Cornhuskers, Skinner was nearly unstoppable, from the front row as well as the service line.\n\n\nCode\noutsides1 &lt;- season1 |&gt; \n  filter(pos == \"OH\") |&gt; \n  top_n(100, wt=gp) |&gt; \n  mutate(killsperset = kills/s)\n\nskinneroh1 &lt;- outsides1 |&gt; \n  filter(full_name == \"Madi Skinner\")\n\nbar1 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=outsides1, aes(x= hit_pct, y= killsperset, size=kills), alpha = .05\n     ) +\n  geom_point(data=skinneroh1, aes(x= hit_pct, y= killsperset, size=kills), color=\"#0033A0\"\n     ) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Hit Percentage\", \n    y=\"Kills Per Set\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\noutsides2 &lt;- season2 |&gt; \n  filter(pos == \"OH\") |&gt; \n  top_n(100, wt=gp) |&gt; \n  mutate(killsperset = kills/s)\n\nseason2fr &lt;- season2 |&gt; \n  mutate(killsperset = kills/s)\n\nskinneroh2 &lt;- season2fr |&gt; \n  filter(full_name == \"Madisen Skinner\")\n\nbar2 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=outsides2, aes(x= hit_pct, y= killsperset, size=kills), alpha = .05\n     ) +\n  geom_point(data=skinneroh2, aes(x= hit_pct, y= killsperset, size=kills), color=\"#bf5700\"\n     ) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Hit Percentage\", \n    y=\"Kills Per Set\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\noutsides3 &lt;- season3 |&gt; \n  filter(pos == \"OH\") |&gt; \n  top_n(100, wt=gp) |&gt; \n  mutate(killsperset = kills/s)\n\nskinneroh3 &lt;- outsides3 |&gt; \n  filter(full_name == \"Madisen Skinner\")\n\nbar3&lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=outsides3, aes(x= hit_pct, y= killsperset, size=kills), alpha = .05\n     ) +\n  geom_point(data=skinneroh3, aes(x= hit_pct, y= killsperset, size=kills), color=\"#bf5700\"\n     ) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Hit Percentage\", \n    y=\"Kills Per Set\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nbar1+bar2+bar3+\n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"Not only was Skinner utilized on every team, she was efficient\",\n    subtitle = \"Out of the top 100 outsides in games played, Skinner ranked better than at least half in all three seasons, \\nand she ranked near the top in her final college season.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Sports Reference | By Olivia Davenport\"\n  )  & \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkinner has since moved on from college volleyball. She is now on LOVB Austin. A team in the second professional league in the United States. LOVB consists of eight teams around the country and in their inaugural season, guess who won the title. Madi Skinner and LOVB Austin.\nMaybe success follows Skinner or maybe she expects it. Four championships and counting for the young star."
