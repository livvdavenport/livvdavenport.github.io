    "text": "The Kansas City Royals have won two World Series Championships. One in 1985, the other in 2015. 10 years later, the Royals are working toward a third championship with the help of young star Bobby Witt Jr. \nThe Royals drafted Witt second overall in the 2019 MLB draft. Witt made his MLB debut in 2022 and has made an almost instant impact in Kansas City. He is the only shortstop to reach 30-30 seasons (30 Homeruns and 30 Stolen Bases), and he didn’t only do it once, he did it twice. And he’s only played two seasons in the league.\nWitt has made the largest impact offensively. Offensive WAR (oWAR) stands for offensive wins above replacement. Simply put, oWAR measures how many wins a player adds to their team based on their offensive stats compared to an average player. The larger the number, the better they are, the more wins they have added for their team.\nDefensively, Witt is still making a positive impact, but it is not as notable as his offensive performance. Rey Sánchez tops the chart defensively.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\n\nbballhits &lt;- read_csv(\"mlb_hitter_stats_1914_2024.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Player=gsub(\"#\",\"\",Player, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt; \n  mutate(Player=gsub(\"*\",\"\",Player, fixed=TRUE))\n\nbballvalue &lt;- read_csv(\"mlb_hitter_value_1914_2024.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Player=gsub(\"#\",\"\",Player, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt; \n  mutate(Player=gsub(\"*\",\"\",Player, fixed=TRUE))\n\nroyalshits &lt;- bballhits |&gt; \n  filter(Team == \"KCR\") |&gt; \n  filter(Season &gt; 1984) |&gt; \n  filter(grepl(\"\\\\*6\", Pos) == TRUE)\n\nroyalsvalue &lt;- bballvalue |&gt; \n  filter(Team == \"KCR\") |&gt; \n  filter(season &gt; 1984) |&gt; \n  filter(grepl(\"\\\\*6\", Pos) == TRUE) |&gt; \n  mutate(PlayerSeason = paste(Player, season)) \n\n\nbobby2023 &lt;- royalshits |&gt; \n  filter(Player == \"Bobby Witt Jr.\") |&gt; \n  filter(Season == \"2023\")\n\nbobby2024 &lt;- royalshits |&gt; \n  filter(Player == \"Bobby Witt Jr.\") |&gt; \n  filter(Season == \"2024\")\n\nbobbyvalue2023 &lt;- royalsvalue |&gt; \n  filter(Player == \"Bobby Witt Jr.\") |&gt; \n  filter(season == \"2023\")\n\nbobbyvalue2024 &lt;- royalsvalue |&gt; \n  filter(Player == \"Bobby Witt Jr.\") |&gt; \n  filter(season == \"2024\")\n\nbar1 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = royalsvalue, aes(x=reorder(PlayerSeason, oWAR), weight=oWAR), fill = \"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_bar(data = bobbyvalue2023, aes(x=reorder(PlayerSeason, oWAR), weight=oWAR), fill = \"#004687\") +\n  geom_bar(data = bobbyvalue2024, aes(x=reorder(PlayerSeason, oWAR), weight=oWAR), fill = \"#004687\") +coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Offensive Wins Above Replacement\" \n    )\n\nbar2 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = royalsvalue, aes(x=reorder(PlayerSeason, dWAR), weight=dWAR), fill=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_bar(data = bobbyvalue2023, aes(x=reorder(PlayerSeason, dWAR), weight=dWAR), fill = \"#004687\") +\n  geom_bar(data = bobbyvalue2024, aes(x=reorder(PlayerSeason, dWAR), weight=dWAR), fill = \"#004687\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Defensive Wins Above Replacement\"\n    )\n\nbar1 + bar2 + \n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"Offensively, Bobby Witt Jr. is flourishing\",\n    subtitle = \"In his second year in the league, Witt no only beat himself, but topped every \\nother shortstop in the offensive category.

Rbat shows how many runs a player generates with their bat.\nFor both of these statistics, zero is the baseline and positive numbers equal a positive correlation.\nWhen it comes to the Rfield value, +15 is Golden Glove territory, and +5 to +15 is above average. -5 to –15 is not abysmal, but they are hurting their team significantly.\nRbat is similar in the fact that positive numbers are a good thing. In two seasons Bobby Witt Jr. has created more runs with his bat than any other short stop that has played for the Royals.\nDefensively, he is slightly below average and still Rey Sánchez’s impact shows up in the field.\n\n\nCode\ncareerRvalues &lt;- royalsvalue |&gt; \n  group_by(Player) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    CareerRfield = sum(Rfield),\n    CareerRbat =sum(Rbat)\n    )\nggplot() +\n  geom_dumbbell(data=careerRvalues, aes(y=Player, x=CareerRfield, xend=CareerRbat),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"lightgrey\",\n    colour_x = \"#BD9B60\",\n    colour_xend = \"#004687\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept=0, color=\"red\", size = .5) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n    labs(title = \"Offense is his forte, but he holds his ground defensively\", \n         subtitle = \"Witt is scoring significantly more runs than a replacement player would and defensively,\\nhe is just below average.\",\n         y=\"\",\n         x=\"Runs Contributed vs Runs Stopped\",\ncaption = \"Source: Sports Reference | By Olivia Davenport\") +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) \n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\nWarning: Using the `size` aesthetic with geom_segment was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use the `linewidth` aesthetic instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaking a closer look at offense, Witt makes the top three in offensive production. Playing in 319 games in his first two seasons, he made an instant impact. He is third to Alcides Escobar, who played more than 1,000 games for Kansas City, and Ángel Berroa who played 583 games. With much fewer chances, Witt has done nearly as much as Berroa. Witt’s success has been noticed as he was selected for the 2024 All-Star game.\n\n\nCode\ncareer &lt;- royalshits |&gt; \n  group_by(Player) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    CareerHR = sum(HR),\n    CareerRBI = sum(RBI),\n    CareerDoubles = sum(`2B`),\n    CareerTriples = sum(`3B`),\n    Offense = CareerHR + CareerRBI\n  )\nScoring &lt;- career |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols=starts_with(\"C\"),\n    names_to=\"Type\"\n  )\n\n ggplot() +\n   geom_bar(data=Scoring, aes(x=reorder(Player,Offense), weight=Offense, fill = Type)) +\n   scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"#004687\",\"#BD9B60\",\"#7AB2DD\",\"lightgrey\"), name=\"\") +\n   coord_flip() +\n   theme_minimal() +\n   labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Offensive Production\",\n    title=\"At the plate, Witt is a problem for pitchers\", \n    subtitle=\"With over 200 fewer games under his belt, Bobby Witt Jr. is comparable to \\nÁngel Berroa when it comes to offensive appearances.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Olivia Davenport\"\n    ) +\n     theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBobby Witt Jr. Is certainly a key piece to the Royals success and the Royals front office knows that. Witt recently signed an 11-year deal worth more than $288 million.\nLast year, the Royals made it back to the postseason for the first time since their last World Series win in 2015 and there is no doubt, Witt had something to do with that. The Royals finished 86-76 last year after 109 losses the season before. Baseball is a team sport, but Bobby Witt Jr. Single-handedly makes the Royals better."
